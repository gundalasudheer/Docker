Why docker is able to run the application with different os distrubutions using the OS kernel virtualization?

   when we look at the Operating systems, it will consist of OS kernel and some softwares above that.
   these softwares are the difference between the different distributions of OS which will change the UI and functionalities etc.

So, in the containers these additional softwares are used and share the OS kernel under the Docker Which makes the applications run as expected. 
So we can use Docker for all the linux distributions operationg systems.
But for windows OS we will use Linux VM to run the docker.

Difference between VMs and Docker
VMs:
  these are used to run and isolate different operating systems by sharing the hardware resources of the physcial system.
1. it will have higher utilization of underline resources due multiple OS and kernel are running
2. it also consume higher disk space as each VM is heavy in gigabytes
3. the boottime is also high as it need to start OS as well
4. VMs has complete isolation as each VM contains its own operating system.
5. As VMs dont share under line operating system we can run any operaring system on the same hypervisor.

Docker:
   it is a tool used to containerise the application and its dependencies to deploy.
1. Docker will have less utlization of resources due to sharing the underline OS kernel
2. it consumes less disk space which will be in megabytes
3. the boottime is very less as there is only one OS need to start.
4. it will have less isolation as it will share the underline OS kernel
5. As it will share the underline OS , we will only be able to run the base distribution of the OS kernel i.e linux
6. Unlike VMs containers wont host any OS. so, container only last as long as the process inside it is alive.

Having said the differences there is no VMs vs Dockers instead it is always VMs and docker. So, we use both together for optimising the applications and environments.

Containers vs Images

images: 
   these are the templetes, packages and plan which are used to run the containers.

containers:
    These are the running instance of image which has isolated environment , set of process and resources.
